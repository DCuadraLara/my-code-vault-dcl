# 🧠 My Code Vault – David Cuadra Lara

Welcome to my personal **Code Vault** — a structured monorepo where I store my software development journey, including real projects, DAM coursework, experiments, and practice code.  
I'm currently studying **DAM (Multiplatform Application Development)** while building my path toward a future role as a **Junior Developer / DevOps Engineer**.

This repo is designed to be clean and easy to navigate.  
Below you’ll find an overview of the **main projects**, **FP (DAM) exercises**, and **learning areas** I’m working on.

## 🚀 Highlighted Projects

These are the projects that represent my current technical level and learning focus.

### **1. Club Náutico – Java OOP Console Application**
📁 `projects/java/club-nautico-java/`  
A full Java console management system built to practice **Object-Oriented Programming**, **inheritance**, **polymorphism**, **clean input validation**, and **modular code design**.

- CRUD system (create, list, modify, delete)  
- Multiple subclasses: `Velero`, `Yate`, `Pesquera`, `Deportiva`  
- Strong input validation & error handling  
- Clean architecture and clear separation of logic  
- Upcoming: JSON persistence + improved menu  

📌 *Project README inside the folder with full documentation.*

## 📚 Coursework – FP DAM

All my official FP (DAM) exercises and assignments are organized here.

📁 `fp_dam/`

Includes:

- **PROG** – Programming (Java, algorithms, OOP fundamentals)  
- **BD** – Databases (SQL, UML diagrams, schemas)  
- **LM** – Lenguajes de Marcas (XML, DTD, HTML/CSS basics)  
- **SI** – Systems & environment configuration
- **ING** - Technical english
- **IPE** - Workplace Safety & Risk Prevention (occupational hazards, safety measures, regulations)
- More modules will be added as the course progresses.

This section represents my formal academic work.

## 🧪 Experiments, Tests & Small Scripts  (WIP)
📁 `tests/`, `python/scripts/`, `sandbox/`

These folders contain:

- small prototypes  
- utility scripts  
- logic practice  
- quick experiments  
- algorithm exercises  

Not polished projects, but proof of daily practice and exploration.

## 🛠 Tech I’m Actively Working With

- **Java** (OOP, inheritance, domain modeling, validation)
- **Python** (automation, APIs) – *later in the year*
- **Git & GitHub**
- **SQL** (MySQL, SQLite)
- **JSON & XML**
- **CLI workflows**
- **Basic DevOps concepts** (CI/CD, containers – upcoming)

## 🎯 My Current Focus

- Mastering **Java OOP** with real mini-projects  
- Building a strong portfolio while studying  
- Writing clean, readable and maintainable code  
- Preparing for a future **Junior Developer** position  
- Stepping into **DevOps** step by step (CI/CD, pipelines, Linux)

I update this repository regularly as I learn and build more things.
